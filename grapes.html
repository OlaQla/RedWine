                                <p class="pOrigin"> Cabernet Franc is believed to have been established in the
                                    Libournais region of southwest France sometime in the 17th century, when Cardinal
                                    Richelieu transported cuttings of the vine to the Loire Valley. They were planted at
                                    the Abbey of Bourgueil under the care of an abbot named Breton, whose name became
                                    associated with the grape. </br><br>By the 18th century, plantings of Cabernet Franc
                                    (known
                                    as Bouchet) were found throughout Fronsac, Pomerol and St-Emilion, making quality
                                    wines. </br><br>As Cabernet Sauvignon grew more popular in the 18th and 19th
                                    centuries, the
                                    close similarity of the two grapes was observed and theories emerged as to the
                                    extent of their relationship. In 1997, DNA evidence emerged to show that Cabernet
                                    Franc had crossed with Sauvignon blanc to produce Cabernet Sauvignon.
                                    </br>
                                    </br>
                                    In
                                    general,
                                    Cabernet Franc is very similar to Cabernet Sauvignon, but buds and ripens at
                                    least a
                                    week earlier. This trait allows the vine to thrive in slightly cooler climates
                                    than
                                    Cabernet Sauvignon, such as the Loire Valley. </br><br>In Bordeaux, plantings of
                                    Cabernet
                                    Franc are treated as an "insurance policy" against inclement weather close to
                                    harvest that may damage plantings of Cabernet Sauvignon. Its early budding does
                                    pose
                                    the viticultural hazard of coulure early in the growing season. The vine is
                                    vigorous and upright, with dark-green, 5-lobed leaves. The winged bunches are
                                    elongated and small-medium in size. The berries are quite small and blue-black
                                    in
                                    color, with fairly thin skins.The Cabernet Franc grapevine is more prone to
                                    mutation than Cabernet Sauvignon, less so than Pinot noir. </br>

                                    Across the
                                    world Cabernet Franc is one of the twenty most widely planted grape varieties.
                                    Plantings are found throughout Europe, in the New World,
                                    China and Kazakhstan. In many regions, it is planted as a component of a
                                    Bordeaux-style blend such as Meritage, playing secondary role to Cabernet
                                    Sauvignon
                                    and Merlot. In parts of northeast Italy, Anjou-Saumur, Touraine and the right

                                    region of Bordeaux, Cabernet Franc both plays a more prominent role in blends
                                    and is
                                    vinted as a varietal.</p>

                                <p class="pTasting">Cabernet Franc might be described as the grntly side of Cabernet
                                    Sauvignon. It is subtly fragrant and gently flirtatious rather than massively
                                    muscular and tough in youth. </br>
                                    <br>
                                    Cabernet Franc is medium-bodied red wine whose
                                    origins likely lie in the Basque country of France. The wine is loved for its
                                    savory, bell pepper-like flavors, medium-high acidity and mouthwatering taste. It is
                                    an ideal food pairing wine. You can find single-varietal Cabernet Franc wines, but
                                    the variety is also quite popular as blending grape in the famous Bordeaux Blend.

                                <p class="pOrigin">For many years, the origin of Cabernet Sauvignon was not clearly
                                    understood and many myths and conjectures surrounded it. The word "Sauvignon" is
                                    believed to be derived from the French sauvage meaning "wild" and to refer to the
                                    grape being a wild Vitis vinifera vine native to France. </br><br>Until recently the
                                    grape
                                    was rumored to have ancient origins, perhaps even being the Biturica grape used to
                                    make ancient Roman wine and referenced by Pliny the Elder. This belief was widely
                                    held in the 18th century, when the grape was also known as Petite Vidure or Bidure,
                                    apparently a corruption of Biturica.</br><br> There was also belief that Vidure was
                                    a
                                    reference to the hard wood (French vigne dure) of the vine, with a possible
                                    relationship to Carménère which was once known as Grand Vidure.Another theory
                                    was that the grapevine originated in the Rioja region of Spain.</br><br>

                                    While the period when the name Cabernet Sauvignon became more prevalent over
                                    Petite
                                    Vidure is not certain, records indicate that the grape was a popular Bordeaux
                                    planting in the 18th century Médoc region. The first estates known to have
                                    actively
                                    grown the variety (and the likely source of Cabernet vines for other estates)
                                    were
                                    Château Mouton and Château d'Armailhac in Pauillac. </br>
                                    <br>

                                    The grape's true origins were discovered in 1996 with the use of DNA typing at
                                    the
                                    UC Davis Department of Viticulture and Enology, by a team led by Dr. Carole
                                    Meredith. The DNA evidence determined that Cabernet Sauvignon was the offspring
                                    of
                                    Cabernet franc and Sauvignon blanc and was most likely a chance crossing that
                                    occurred in the 17th century. </br><br>Prior to this discovery, this origin had been
                                    suspected from the similarity of the grapes' names and the fact that Cabernet
                                    Sauvignon shares similar aromas with both grapes—such as the blackcurrant and
                                    pencil
                                    box aromas of Cabernet franc and the grassiness of Sauvignon blanc. In 2016
                                    scientists at the UC Davis announced they had sequenced a draft of the whole
                                    genome
                                    of the Cabernet Sauvignon grape, the first genome of a commercial wine-producing
                                    grape to be sequenced.</p>

                                <p class="pTasting">Cabs are decidedly dry in style and range from medium-bodied to
                                    full-bodied. They are characterized by higher tannins, which serve to provide
                                    structure and complexity while supporting the rich dark fruit characteristics. The
                                    most common aromatic and flavor components found in Cabernet Sauvignon are plum,
                                    black cherry, blackberry, blueberry, warm spice, vanilla, black pepper, tobacco and
                                    sometimes leather aromas and or flavors.</br>

                                    Thanks to the tighter tannins in Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine is built for fat and
                                    protein. Red meat, in particular, is its first love. Everything from burgers and
                                    brats to prime rib and grilled game, hearty, sausage dishes, lamb and
                                    strong-flavored cheese (think Stilton, cheddar, Gruyere) all find their mark with a
                                    Cab. </p>

                                <p class="pOrigin">The earliest recorded mention of Merlot
                                    was in the notes of a local Bordeaux official who in 1784 labeled wine made from the
                                    grape in the Libournais region as one of the area's best. In 1824, the word Merlot
                                    itself appeared in an article on Médoc wine where it was described that the grape
                                    was named after the local black bird who liked eating the ripe grapes on the
                                    vine.</br><br>
                                    Other
                                    descriptions of the grape from the 19th century called the variety lou seme doù
                                    flube ("the seedling from the river") with the grape thought to have
                                    originated on one of the islands found along the Garonne river.</br>
                                    <br>
                                    By the 19th century it was being regularly planted in the Médoc on the "Left Bank"
                                    of the Gironde. After a series of setbacks that includes a severe frost in 1956
                                    and several vintages in the 1960s lost to rot, French authorities in Bordeaux banned
                                    new plantings of Merlot vines between 1970 and 1975.</br><br>

                                    It was first recorded in Italy around Venice under the synonym Bordò in 1855. The
                                    grape was introduced to the Swiss, from Bordeaux, sometime in the 19th century and
                                    was recorded in the Swiss canton of Ticino between 1905 and 1910. </br><br>In the
                                    1990s,
                                    Merlot saw an upswing of popularity in the United States. Red wine consumption, in
                                    general, increased in the US following the airing of the 60 Minutes report on the
                                    French Paradox and the potential health benefits of wine and, possibly, the chemical
                                    resveratrol. The popularity of Merlot stemmed in part from the relative ease in
                                    pronouncing the name of the wine as well as its softer, fruity
                                    profile that made it more approachable to some wine drinkers.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Merlot is one of the world's most widely planted grape variety with plantings of the
                                    vine outpacing even the more well-known Cabernet Sauvignon in many regions,
                                    including the grape's homeland of France. Here, France is home to nearly two
                                    thirds of the world's total plantings of Merlot. </br><br>Beyond France it is also
                                    grown
                                    in Italy (where it is the country's 5th most planted grape), Algeria,California,
                                    Romania, Australia, Argentina, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Greece, New Zealand, South
                                    Africa, Switzerland, Croatia, Hungary, Montenegro, Slovenia, Mexico and other parts
                                    of the United States such as Washington, Virginia and Long Island. It grows in many
                                    regions that also grow Cabernet Sauvignon but tends to be cultivated in the cooler
                                    portions of those areas. In areas that are too warm, Merlot will ripen too
                                    early.</br>
                                    <br>
                                    In places like Israel, Merlot is the second most widely planted grape variety after
                                    Cabernet Sauvignon with 1,000 hectares in cultivation, making very
                                    "New World-style" wines. The grape can also be found in Turkey with 429 hectares
                                    in 2010 as well as Malta and Cyprus.
                                </p>
                                <p class="pTasting">Merlot tends to have a similar flavor profile to Cabernet Sauvignon
                                    and is actually within the same family of grape. The main difference between these
                                    grapes is that Merlot has a thinner skin and tends
                                    to be less astringent due to fewer and softer tannins.</br>
                                    <br>
                                    Merlot is famously a smooth, velvety wine and it is often the texture of Merlot that
                                    is commented upon, rather than taste. The grape can produce soft, medium or
                                    full-bodied wines. As is often the case, the wines vary greatly depending on the
                                    climate in which the Merlot grape is cultivated.

                                    With plummy and chocolatey notes, it is an easy-drinking red and often recommended
                                    for red wine beginners.</p>

                                    Malbec is a purple grape variety used in making red wine. The
                                    grapes tend to have an inky dark color and robust tannins, and are known as one of
                                    the six grapes allowed in the blend of red Bordeaux wine. The French plantations of
                                    Malbec are now found primarily in Cahors in South West France. It is increasingly
                                    celebrated as an Argentine varietal wine and is being grown around the world.</br>
                                    <br>
                                    Called Malbec in Bordeaux, Auxerrois or Côte Noir in Cahors, and Pressac in other
                                    places, the grape became less popular in Bordeaux after 1956 when frost killed off
                                    75% of the crop. Despite Cahors being hit by the same frost, which devastated the
                                    vineyards, Malbec was replanted and continued to be popular in that area where it
                                    was mixed with Merlot and Tannat to make dark, full-bodied wines, and more recently
                                    has been made into 100% Malbec varietal wines.</br>
                                    <br>
                                    The Malbec grape is a thick-skinned grape and needs more sun and heat than either
                                    Cabernet Sauvignon or Merlot to mature. It ripens mid-season and can bring very
                                    deep color, ample tannin, and a particular plum-like flavor component to add
                                    complexity to claret blends. Sometimes, especially in its traditional growing
                                    regions, it is not trellised and cultivated as bush vines. Here
                                    it is sometimes kept to a relatively low yield of about 6 tons per hectare. The
                                    wines are rich, dark and juicy.</br><br>

                                    As a varietal, Malbec creates a rather inky red (or violet), intense wine, so it is
                                    also commonly used in blends, such as with Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon to create
                                    the red French Bordeaux claret blend. The grape is blended with Cabernet Franc and
                                    Gamay in some regions such as the Loire Valley. Other wine regions use the grape
                                    to produce Bordeaux-style blends.The varietal is sensitive to frost and has a
                                    proclivity to shatter or coulure.</br>
                                    <br>
                                    Malbec is the dominant red varietal in Cahors where the Appellation Controlée
                                    regulations for Cahors require a minimum content of 70%. Introduced to Argentina
                                    by French agricultural engineer Michel Pouget in 1868, Malbec is widely planted in
                                    Argentina producing a softer, less tannic-driven variety than the wines of Cahors.
                                    There were once 50,000 hectares planted with Malbec in Argentina; now there are
                                    25,000 hectares in Mendoza in addition to production in La Rioja, Salta, San Juan,
                                    Catamarca and Buenos Aires. </br><br>Chile has about 6,000 hectares planted, France
                                    5,300
                                    hectares and in the cooler regions of California just 45 hectares. In California the
                                    grape is used to make Meritage. Malbec is also grown in Washington State, the
                                    Rogue and Umpqua regions of Oregon, the Grand Valley AVA of Colorado, Australia, New
                                    Zealand, South Africa, Brazil, British Columbia, the Long Island AVA of New York,
                                    Oregon, southern Bolivia, northeastern Italy and recently in Texas and southern
                                    Ontario, Virginia, and in the Baja California region of Mexico.

                                <p class="pTasting">Malbec is a full-bodied, deep inky coloured wine with relatively
                                    high alcohol content. Watch out for the magenta rim left in the wine glass with
                                    Malbec wines. Aromas of dark berries are commonly associated with Malbec – dark
                                    cherries, plums or blueberries are predictable.</br>
                                    <br>
                                    Note that there is a marked difference in taste between Old World and New World
                                    produced Malbecs. Argentinian (New World) wines evoke the fruity flavours mentioned
                                    above, while Old World Malbec is often described as leathery, with a more savoury
                                    edge.</p>

                                <p class="pOrigin">Nebbiolo is an Italian red wine grape variety predominantly
                                    associated
                                    with its native Piedmont region, where it makes the Denominazione di Origine
                                    Controllata e Garantita wines of Barolo, Barbaresco, Roero, Gattinara, Carema
                                    and Ghemme. Nebbiolo is thought to derive its name from the Italian nebbia or
                                    Piedmontese nebia, meaning "fog". </br><br>During harvest, which generally takes
                                    place late
                                    in October, a deep, intense fog sets into the Langhe region where many Nebbiolo
                                    vineyards are located. Alternative explanations refers to the fog-like gloucous veil
                                    that forms over the berries as they reach maturity, or that perhaps the name is
                                    derived instead from the Italian word nobile.</p>
                                <p class="pTasting">Nebbiolo produces lightly-colored red wines which can be highly
                                    tannic in youth with scents of tar and roses. As they age, the wines take on a
                                    characteristic brick-orange hue at the rim of the glass and mature to reveal other
                                    aromas and flavors such as violets, tar, wild herbs, cherries, raspberries,
                                    truffles, tobacco, and prunes. Nebbiolo wines can require years of aging to balance
                                    the tannins with other characteristics.</p>

                                    Côte-d'Or. It is also planted in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Bulgaria, Canada,
                                    Chile, northern parts of Croatia, Czech Republic, the Republic of Georgia, Germany,

                                    United States and Uruguay. </br><br>The United States has increasingly become a
                                    major Pinot
                                    noir producer, with some of the best regarded coming from the Willamette Valley in
                                    Oregon and California's Sonoma County with its Russian River Valley and Sonoma Coast
                                    appellations. Lesser known appellations can be found in Mendocino County's Anderson
                                    Valley, as well as the Central Coast's Santa Lucia Highlands appellation, the Santa
                                    Maria Valley and Sta. Rita Hills American Viticulture Area in Santa Barbara County.
                                    In New Zealand, it is principally grown in Martinborough, Marlborough, Waipara and
                                    Central Otago.</br>

                                    The leaves of pinot noir are generally smaller than those of Cabernet Sauvignon or
                                    Syrah. The pinot vine is typically less vigorous than either of these varieties. The
                                    grape cluster is small and conico-cylindrical; shaped like a pine cone. Some
                                    viticultural historians believe this shape similarity may have given rise to the
                                    name. In the vineyard Pinot noir is sensitive to wind and frost, cropping levels,
                                    soil types and pruning
                                    techniques. </br><br>In the winery it is sensitive to fermentation methods, yeast
                                    strains and
                                    is highly reflective of its terroir with different regions producing very different
                                    wines. Its thin skin makes it susceptible to bunch rot and similar fungal diseases.
                                    The vines themselves are susceptible to powdery mildew, especially in Burgundy
                                    infection by leaf roll and fanleaf viruses causes significant vine health problems.

                                    However, Pinot noir wines are among the most popular in the world. Joel Fleischman
                                    of Vanity Fair describes pinot noir as "the most romantic of wines, with so
                                    voluptuous a perfume, so sweet an edge, and so powerful a punch that, like falling
                                    in love, they make the blood run hot and the soul wax embarrassingly poetic."
                                    Master Sommelier Madeline Triffon calls Pinot "sex in a glass".</p>
                                <p class="pTasting">The tremendously broad range of bouquets, flavors, textures and
                                    impressions that Pinot noir can produce sometimes confuses tasters. In the
                                    broadest terms, the wine tends to be of light to medium body with an aroma
                                    reminiscent of black and/or red cherry, raspberry and to a lesser extent currant and
                                    many other fine small red and black berry fruits. Traditional red Burgundy is famous
                                    for its savory fleshiness and "farmyard" aromas, but changing fashions, modern
                                    winemaking
                                    techniques, and new easier-to-grow clones have favored a lighter, more
                                    fruit-prominent, cleaner style.</br>
                                    <br>
                                    The wine's color when young is often compared to that of garnet, frequently being
                                    much lighter than that of other red wines. This is entirely natural and not a
                                    winemaking fault as Pinot noir has a lower skin anthocyanin
                                    content than most other classical red/black varieties. </br>
                                    <br>
                                    However, an emerging, increasingly evident, style from California and New Zealand
                                    highlights a more powerful, fruit forward and darker wine that can tend toward Syrah
                                    (or even new world Malbec) in depth, extract, and alcoholic content.</p>

                                <p class="pOrigin">Pinotage is a grape variety that was created in South Africa in 1925
                                    by Abraham Izak Perold, the first Professor of Viticulture at Stellenbosch
                                    University. Perold was attempting to combine the best qualities of the robust
                                    Hermitage with Pinot noir, a grape that makes great wine but can be difficult to
                                    grow. The first wine was made in 1941 at Elsenburg, with the
                                    first commercial plantings at Myrtle Grove near Sir Lowry's Pass.</br><br>
                                    The first recognition came when a Bellevue wine made from Pinotage became the
                                    champion wine at the Cape Wine Show of 1959. This wine would become the first wine
                                    to mention Pinotage on its label in 1961, when Stellenbosch Farmer's Winery
                                    marketed it under their Lanzerac brand.This early success, and its easy
                                    viticulture, prompted a wave of planting during the 1960s.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    In addition to South Africa, Pinotage is also grown in Brazil, Canada, Israel, New
                                    Zealand, United States and Zimbabwe. In New Zealand, there are 94 acres (38 ha) of
                                    Pinotage. In the US, there are plantings in Arizona, California, Michigan, Oregon
                                    and Virginia. German winemakers have recently begun experimenting with the
                                    grape.</p>
                                <p class="pTasting">Pinotage is a dense wine, with strong colours and bold flavours. As
                                    a single varietal, the wine is distinctive. It has notes of cherry, plum, tobacco
                                    and tar and can be quite bitter. Young Pinotage wines are often more palatable and
                                    easier to drink than older varieties.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    A word of warning – the volatile nature of Pinotage can mean it occasionally
                                    develops an unpleasantly acidic taste, similar to acetone. Aim for a high quality
                                    Pinotage to ensure the taste is perfect.</p>

                                <p class="pOrigin">Syrah also known as Shiraz, is a dark-skinned grape
                                    variety grown throughout the world and used primarily to produce red wine. In 1999,
                                    Syrah was found to be the offspring of two obscure grapes from southeastern France,
                                    Dureza and Mondeuse Blanche.Syrah should not be confused with Petite Sirah, a
                                    cross of Syrah with Peloursin dating from 1880.</br>
                                    <br>
                                    The style and flavor profile of wines made from Syrah is influenced by the climate
                                    where the grapes are grown with moderate climates tending to produce medium to
                                    full-bodied wines with medium-plus to high levels of tannins and notes of
                                    blackberry, mint and black pepper. In hot climates, Syrah is more consistently
                                    full-bodied with softer tannin, jammier fruit and spice notes of licorice, anise and
                                    earthy leather. In many regions the acidity and tannin levels of Syrah allow the
                                    wines produced to have favorable aging potential.</br>
                                    <br>
                                    Syrah is used as a single varietal or as a blend. Following several years of strong
                                    planting, Syrah was estimated in 2004 to be the world's 7th most grown grape at
                                    352,000 acres. It can be found throughout the globe from
                                    France to New World wine regions such as: Chile, South Africa, the Hawke's Bay,
                                    Waiheke, New Zealand, California and Washington. It can also be found in several
                                    Australian wine regions such as: Barossa, Heathcote, Coonawarra, Hunter Valley,
                                    Margaret River and McLaren Vale.</p>
                                <p class="pTasting">Syrah/Shiraz wines are rich, spicy, intensely flavoured and dark in
                                    colour. The wines are full-bodied and dry. French Syrah tends to border on smoky,
                                    herby and is higher in acidity. New World style Shiraz wines from Australia and USA
                                    tend to be richer, softer with notes of chocolate or occasionally leather.</p>

                                    Grenache or Garnacha (as it is known in Spain) most likely originated in the region
                                    of Aragon in northern Spain, according to ampelographical evidence.Plantings
                                    probably spread from the original birthplace to Catalonia and other lands under the
                                    Crown of Aragon such as Sardinia and Roussillon in southern France. An early synonym
                                    for the vine was Tinto Aragonés (red of Aragon). </br><br>The grape is known as

                                    Sardinia, where it is claimed that it originated there and spread to other
                                    Mediterranean lands under Aragon rule.Grenache, under its Spanish synonym
                                    Garnacha, was already well established on both sides of the Pyrenees when the
                                    Roussillon region was annexed by France. </br><br>From there the vine made its way
                                    through
                                    the Languedoc and to the Southern Rhone region where it was well established by the
                                    19th century. Despite its prevalence in nearby Navarra and Catalonia, Garnacha was
                                    not widely planted in the Rioja till the early 20th century as vineyards were
                                    replanted following the phylloxera epidemic.</br>
                                    <br>
                                    Grenache was one of the first varieties to be introduced to Australia in the 18th
                                    century and eventually became the country's most widely planted red wine grape
                                    variety until it was surpassed by Shiraz in the mid 1960s.Early Australian
                                    Grenache was a main component in the sweet fortified wines that was the lynchpin of
                                    the early Australian wine industry. </br><br>In the 19th century, California wine
                                    growers
                                    prized the vine's ability to produce high yields and withstand heat and drought
                                    conditions. The grape was extensively planted throughout the hot San Joaquin Valley
                                    where it was mainly used as a blending component for pale, sweet jug wines. In the
                                    late 20th century, the Rhone Rangers movement brought attention to the production of
                                    premium varietal Grenache and Rhone style blends modeled after the Grenache dominate
                                    wines of Châteauneuf-du-Pape. </br><br>In the early 20th century, Grenache was one
                                    of the
                                    first Vitis vinifera grapes to be successfully vinified during the early development
                                    of the Washington wine industry with a 1966 Yakima Valley rosé earning mention in
                                    wine historian Leon Adams treatise The Wines of America.

                                <p class="pTasting">The unmistakable candied fruit roll-up and cinnamon flavor is what
                                    gives Grenache away to expert blind tasters. It has a medium-bodied taste due to its
                                    higher alcohol, but has a deceptively lighter color and is semi-translucent.
                                    Depending on where it’s grown, Grenache often has subtle aromas of orange rinds and
                                    ruby-red grapefruit. When Grenache is grown in Old World regions such as Côtes du
                                    Rhône and Sardinia, it can have herbal notes of dried oregano and tobacco.</p>

                                <p class="pOrigin">Zinfandel (also known as Primitivo) is a variety of black-skinned
                                    wine grape. The variety is grown in over 10 percent of California vineyards. DNA
                                    analysis has revealed that it is genetically equivalent to the Croatian grapes
                                    Crljenak Kaštelanski and Tribidrag, as well as to the Primitivo variety
                                    traditionally grown in Apulia (the "heel" of Italy), where it was introduced in the
                                    18th century. The grape found its way to the United States in the mid-19th
                                    century, where it became known by variations of a name applied to a different grape,
                                    likely "Zierfandler" from Austria.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The grapes typically produce a robust red wine, although in the United States a
                                    semi-sweet rosé (blush-style) wine called White Zinfandel has six times the sales of
                                    the red wine.The grape's high sugar content can be fermented into levels of
                                    alcohol exceeding 15 percent.</br>
                                    <br>
                                    The taste of the red wine depends on the ripeness of the grapes from which it is
                                    made. Red berry fruit flavors like raspberry predominate in wines from cooler
                                    areas, whereas blackberry, anise and pepper notes are more common in wines made
                                    in warmer areas and in wines made from the earlier-ripening Primitivo clone.</p>
                                <p class="pTasting">The primary flavors of Zinfandel are jam, blueberry, black pepper,
                                    cherry, plum, boysenberry, cranberry, and licorice. When you taste Zinfandel it
                                    often explodes with candied fruitiness followed by spice and often a tobacco-like
                                    smoky finish.</br>
                                    <br>
                                    Zinfandel is lighter in color than both Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot.
                                    However, although a light-bodied red wine like Pinot Noir, Zin’s moderate tannin and
                                    high acidity make it taste bold. Generally speaking, most Zinfandel wines have
                                    higher alcohol levels ranging from about 14 – 17% ABV. Higher alcohol adds an oily
                                    texture and bigger, bolder body.
